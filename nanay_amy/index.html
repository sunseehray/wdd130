        <h1>Buy Yourself Time</h1>
        <p>As a woman living in the city, it’s a miracle to find time to do everything. With a 9-hour shift and two hours or more in traffic, you’re still expected to have time to take care of your family, meet your friends, extend volunteer hours, and pursue continued professional development! How will you even have time for yourself? How many hours of sleep do you get per day? When was the last time you enjoyed spending time on your own? </p>
        <p>Imagine finally being able to read that book you’ve been meaning to, catching up with old friends, and playing with those little ones who have been craving for attention.
