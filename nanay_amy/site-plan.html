     <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Nanay Amy has been doing housekeeping for a long time. From big families with children to young professionals, she has served a wide variety of clientele. Despite her expertise, not many people know about her and the specific services she offers. Hence, this website was developed to help build awareness on what Nanay Amy can do, how much a client is expected to pay, and how to contact her to avail of her services or to inquire about special requests. 
        The website also aims to showcase the reviews that Nanay Amy has from her previous clients, so that new clients will have the confidence to avail of her services. Her services would include general cleaning, ironing and laundry, and cooking. There will also be a section that will showcase some of the unique services she offers such as gardening, catering, and disposal of old and bulky items.</p>  <!-- 150-200 words minimum --> 

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Life in Bonifacio Global City can be very busy. With a large industry of IT professionals and BPO employees, the target audience for Nanay Amy's Housekeeping are families or young professionals who lack the time to do housekeeping. These potential clients also live within a 10-km radius. Since Nanay Amy is not a full-time stay-at-home service, her target audience also includes those who are only looking for part-time or stay-out housekeeper. As a one-woman service, potential clients also include those who want to have their hired housekeepers trained. Her service packages range from single-dwellers to a full household. She can also accept special requests from these same clients to serve a wider audience such as cooking for a large party. In case she is fully booked, clients can get waitlisted, and Nanay Amy will serve them on a first-come first-served basis depending on urgency as well.</p>  <!-- 150-200 word minimum -->
