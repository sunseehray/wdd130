    <h2>"Shine"</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone! I'm Shine, and I am from The Philippines. I'm married to an IT guy, and, together, we have three boys. It's hot in here where I stay, but it's bountiful with seafood and fresh fruits.</p> 
    <p>I've been a member of the Church since my infancy. One of my favorite scriptures would be D&C 42:42. It's something that I always tell my kids when they murmur about helping around the house.</p>
    <p>Just this week, I was taking up business classes for my associate's in applied business management. Then, I decided to drop them and register for tech classes. I plan to pursue a bachelor's degree in applied technology instead.</p>
    <p>I love BYUI because of the spirit. The advantage I see from a career in web design is that I can work from home. Plus, it's like solving puzzles, which I really enjoy despite it being frustrating at times.</p>
